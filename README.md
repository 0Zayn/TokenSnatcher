Small thing that gets a discord token from a running discord client via a request they send from their electron app to their API which includes the users token.

PoC to show that discord needs to secure their networking, and that their are many other methods to get the users token other than searching statically through the Discord install directory.

**This is a project made for fun, NOT for malicious reasons**
